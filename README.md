# Capytaine: Nemoh's Python interface

Capytaine is a BEM solver for linear potential flow applied to the computation of the hydrodynamic coefficients of floating structures.
It is based on [Nemoh](https://lheea.ec-nantes.fr/logiciels-et-brevets/nemoh-presentation-192863.kjsp)'s Fortran core for the computation of the Green function, [meshmagick](https://github.com/LHEEA/meshmagick) for the manipulation of meshes, and various tools of the Python scientific stack.


Capytaine is still under development. Use at your own risks.
